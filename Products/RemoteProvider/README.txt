Introduction
============

Providers are used to link to external entities in the internet that provide OSH
relevant information. Several fields offer the possibility to enter meta-information about
these providers.

Boilerplate
===========

First, we must perform some setup. We use the testbrowser that is shipped
with Five, as this provides proper Zope 2 integration. Most of the 
documentation, though, is in the underlying zope.testbrower package.

    >>> from Products.Five.testbrowser import Browser
    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> portal_url = self.portal.absolute_url()

The following is useful when writing and debugging testbrowser tests. It lets
us see all error messages in the error_log.

    >>> self.portal.error_log._ignored_exceptions = ()

With that in place, we can go to the portal front page and log in. We will
do this using the default user from PloneTestCase:

    >>> from Products.PloneTestCase.setup import portal_owner, default_password

    >>> browser.open(portal_url)

We have the login portlet, so let's use that.

    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_name').value = portal_owner
    >>> browser.getControl(name='__ac_password').value = default_password
    >>> browser.getControl(name='submit').click()

Here, we set the value of the fields on the login form and then simulate a
submit click.

We then test that we are still on the portal front page:

    >>> browser.url == portal_url
    True

And we ensure that we get the friendly logged-in message:

    >>> "You are now logged in" in browser.contents
    True


Adding a Provider
===================

We add a Provider and make sure the id is set correctly.

    >>> _ = self.folder.invokeFactory(type_name='Provider', id='myprovider')
    >>> myprovider = self.folder.myprovider
    >>> myprovider.getId()
	'myprovider'

For good measure, we also set a title and test for it.	
	>>> myprovider.setTitle('My Remote Provider')
	>>> myprovider.Title()
	'My Remote Provider'
